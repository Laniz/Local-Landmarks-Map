## Overview

**Project Title**: Local Landmarks Map

**Project Description**:  
An interactive web-based map that displays local landmarks using the Google Maps JavaScript API. It allows users to view categorized markers (e.g., parks, shops, museums), see their own location, and get navigation directions to any marker. Users can also select their preferred travel mode: driving, walking, or bicycling.

**Project Goals**:  
* Display a customizable map with 20+ interactive markers  
* Provide filter buttons to toggle visible marker types  
* Show the user's location on the map  
* Enable route navigation from user location to a selected marker  
* Support multiple travel modes (driving, walking, bicycling)

1. Clone or download the repository into a local folder  
2. Ensure internet access is available (Google Maps loads online)  
3. Open `index.html` using Live Server in VS Code or any local web server (e.g., Python's `http.server`)

Instructions for using the software:

1. Choose a travel mode from the dropdown menu  
2. Filter landmarks using the provided buttons (optional)  
3. Click any marker â†’ Click "Show Route" to generate a path from your location  
4. Click "Hide Route" to remove the path
