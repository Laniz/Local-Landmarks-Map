## Overview

**Project Title**: Local Landmarks Map

**Project Description**:  
An interactive web app that displays local landmarks using the Google Maps JavaScript API. It features 20 categorized markers, displays the user’s current location, provides route navigation from the user to any marker, and allows selection of travel mode (driving, walking, bicycling). Users can also filter landmarks by type (e.g., parks, shops, museums).

**Project Goals**:  
- Create an interactive and informative map using Google Maps  
- Display at least 20 markers with associated information  
- Allow users to click on markers and view location details  
- Support route navigation with adjustable travel mode  
- Enable map filtering by data type
